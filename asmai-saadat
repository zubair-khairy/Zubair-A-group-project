 <h1>Configure FTP Server Site <\h1>
 <p> After you’ve installed all of the necessary components, you may establish an FTP server on your system by establishing a new FTP site, configuring firewall rules, and permitting external networks.
 Open the Control Panel settings once again and tap on the option of “System and Security”. 
Within the “System and Security” window, you will find many options and settings to be modified or updated. Tap on the last most listed option of “Administrative Tools” to continue.
Control Panel > System and Security > Administrative Tools
 
Now the file explorer will open the below “Administrative Tools” folder shown in the image. You will find many options here to be updated. You have to double-tap on the shortcut option of “Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager” to open it.
