 <h1>Configure Firewall Rules <\h1>
 <p> Finally, it’s time to configure some rules for the Firewall.
 Connections to the FTP server would be banned by standard if you have the integrated firewall turned on throughout Windows 10 unless you specifically enable the service to pass.
 Hence, we will be enabling the service of firewall using the Settings of Firewall. Hence, open the Windows Security settings from the search bar of your Windows 10.
 Explore the section of Firewall & Network Protection among all the other services.
 Within the Firewall & Network Protection, click on the blue highlighted line “Allow an app through firewall” stated below in the window.
A new window named “Allowed apps” will be opened, as shown in the image appended below.
 Tap on the button of “Change Settings” to enable the modification and selection of apps and features.
 Now within the sections of Allow apps and features, tick mark the checkbox of FTP Server.
 After that, make sure to checkmark the checkboxes of “Private” and “Public” in front of it to assign public and private permissions to the FTP Server.
 Hit the “OK” button to apply the alterations. The FTP server must now be available from the local area network when we have already finished the procedures.
 If we use a third-party safety tool, try visiting the supplier’s help center for further information on how to establish firewall rules.
